# KisanTech

KisanTech is an advanced **Smart Agriculture Monitoring System** designed to empower farmers with the latest technologies. The project leverages AI, IoT, and data analytics to provide actionable insights, optimize crop production, and enhance sustainability in agriculture.

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Suggests the best crops to plant based on soil, weather, and geographical conditions.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Provides precise fertilizer suggestions tailored to the crop and soil type.
- **Crop Price Prediction**: Forecasts market prices of crops to help farmers make informed decisions.
- **Rainfall Prediction**: Uses weather data to predict rainfall patterns for better planning and irrigation management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (using XAMPP)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn for prediction models
